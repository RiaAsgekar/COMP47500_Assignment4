 Hashing: Spell Checker using Hash Table

This assignment involves the implementation of a spell checker using a hash table. The spell checker is implemented in HashTable.java, and it utilizes the hash table data structure to efficiently store and retrieve words for spell checking.

Contents:

HashTable.java: This file contains the implementation of the hash table used for spell checking. It includes methods for adding words to the hash table and checking if a word is spelled correctly.
Main.java: This file contains the main test class where experiments for spell checking are conducted. It reads a list of words from words.txt and checks each word for spelling errors using the hash table implemented in HashTable.java.
words.txt: This file contains a list of words used for testing the spell checker.

Usage:

To use the spell checker, run the Main class. It will read the words from words.txt, add them to the hash table, and then check each word for spelling errors.

Experimentation:

The Main class conducts experiments to test the performance of the spell checker using the hash table. Time measurements are taken to evaluate the efficiency of adding words to the hash table and checking for spelling errors.

This README provides an overview of the provided code files, their functionalities, and the purpose of the experimentation conducted within the Main.java class.
